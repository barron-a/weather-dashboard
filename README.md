## Description
Weather Dashboard is a web app that allows a user to search for a city and get weather information for that city. When a city is entered in the search bar, the user is given the date, a current weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index for that city. They will also be given a 5-day forecast for the selected city with the date, forecast icon, temperature, and humidity. </br>

Searched cities will be saved to local storage and displayed in a list on the left. The cities can be clicked again, and the weather data will be re-populated for the selected city
